# Phase 2: Control Utilities and Scripted Policies

## Objectives
- Scaffold the control layer that supports inverse kinematics, phase progression, and scripted demonstration policies.
- Ensure each helper function in `control/` is single-purpose, well-typed, and independently testable.
- Provide deterministic scripted policy structures that rely on Phase 1 environment/task stubs without requiring Newton runtime.

## Deliverables
- `control/ik_utils.py` featuring:
  - Functions: `solve_ik`, `ee_pose_from_state`, `plan_rendezvous`, `gripper_command`, `clamp_action`.
  - Clear separation between math helpers (pure `numpy`) and Newton-dependent extraction (guard via conditional imports).
  - TODO markers for numerical methods (e.g., Jacobian computation) with placeholder implementations returning zeros.
- `control/phase_machine.py` containing:
  - `PhaseMachine` class with small methods handling state transitions.
  - `phase_signals_from_state` helper that converts environment/task info into boolean signals (stubbed).
  - Internal helper functions (e.g., `_should_advance`) to keep `step` minimal.
- `control/scripted/` task-specific modules:
  - `lift_demo.py`, `handoff_demo.py`, `drawer_demo.py` implementing `scripted_policy` and `waypoint_library` stubs.
  - Shared helper utilities (e.g., `interpolate_joint_waypoints`) factored into private functions per file.
- `control/__init__.py` exporting canonical entry points for IK and phase tools.

## Task Breakdown
1. **IK Utilities**
   - Implement function signatures with rigorous docstrings explaining expected shapes (e.g., `q_init` is `(n_joints,)`).
   - Provide placeholder math using `numpy.zeros_like` and `np.clip` to keep functions returning valid arrays until algorithms are added.
   - Introduce private helper `_damped_least_squares_step` (stub) to clarify future work without inflating core function.
2. **Phase Machine**
   - `PhaseMachine`:
     - Use dataclass with fields `phases`, `timeouts`, `current_index`, `steps_in_phase`.
     - Methods: `reset`, `step`, `current`, `is_terminal`.
   - Ensure `step` calls `_should_transition` helper to evaluate signals/timeouts, keeping logic testable.
   - `phase_signals_from_state` should accept simple dicts (Phase 1 placeholder) and return typed signals dictionary.
3. **Scripted Policies**
   - Each module defines:
     - `waypoint_library(cfg: Mapping[str, Any]) -> dict[str, np.ndarray]`.
     - `scripted_policy(env: NewtonMAEnv, phase_machine: PhaseMachine, obs: list[dict]) -> list[np.ndarray]`.
   - Provide small helper functions (`_grasp_sequence`, `_handoff_sync_step`) so scripted_policy remains readable.
   - Use deterministic seeding and configuration references for reproducibility.
   - Document expected tasks and phases in module-level docstrings linking back to Phase 1 tasks.

## Testing Strategy
- `tests/test_ik_utils.py`:
  - Validate output shapes and clipping behavior for placeholder IK functions.
  - Ensure `clamp_action` respects max norm using controlled inputs.
- `tests/test_phase_machine.py`:
  - Test initialization, progression via signals, timeout triggers, and terminal detection.
  - Use minimal signals dictionaries; each test focuses on one transition rule.
- `tests/test_scripted_policies.py`:
  - Mock `NewtonMAEnv` and `PhaseMachine` to check that scripted policies call IK helpers and return two actions.
  - Confirm waypoint libraries expose required keys.

## Quality & Maintainability Notes
- Keep public functions <= ~25 lines with private helpers capturing repeated logic.
- Leverage `numpy.typing.NDArray` for type hints to improve clarity and future static analysis.
- Make all scripted policy functions pure (no hidden global state); pass dependencies explicitly.
- Provide informative `NotImplementedError` messages in stubs so future developers understand missing pieces quickly.
